# Bayesian analysis of SANS data

```{admonition} Task
:class: important
Consider the SANS data and model from earlier, your colleague suggests that the solution contains an equal mixture of two types of spherical particle in the solution, one approximately ten times smaller than the other.
This would involve the mathematical model that takes the average from two spherical particle models.

How would you go about investigating this using a Bayesian method?
