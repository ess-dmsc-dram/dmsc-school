Bayesian methods
    analytical methodology that takes advantage of [Bayesian logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics)

credible intervals
    The Bayesian equivalent to a confidence interval, the parameter is likely to fall within this interval with the given percentage

homoscedastic
    the variance for each data point is the same for all values

likelihood
    the probability distribution of some observed data in terms of model parameters

Markov chain Monte Carlo
    a random sampling technique that is used to investigate probability distributions

maximum likelihood estimation
    the model and parameters that obtain the maximum of the likelihood function for the data

model dataset
    the data that arises from our mathematical model

nested sampling
    a approach to estimate the multi-dimension integral that gives the Bayesian evidence

normal distribution
    a probability distribution that is often used in the natural sciences to represent real-valued random variables, i.e. experimental measurements, also known as a Gaussian distribution

optimisation algorithm
    the process used to *try* and get the best agreement between our model and experimental datasets

parameters
    values within our mathematical model that may be changed

posterior distribution
    the result of the product of the likelihood and prior probabilities

prior knowledge
    what we already know about our system before looking at our data, e.g., from other measurements of underlying physics/chemistry

thinning
    the sub-sampling of MCMC chains to remove correlation between samples

walkers
    unique samplers in a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
