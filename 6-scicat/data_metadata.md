# Data and Metadata

The interesting questions which are asked over and over are __what is data and what is metadata?__  
It is not an easy task to answer such questions. The answers are multiple and varies depending whos is answering and their background.

According to the literature ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5]), data and metadata are often defined as follow:

#### Data
> Data are raw and unorganized measurements or facts that has been observed at a specirfic point in time.

#### Metadata
> Metadata is data about data, or data that provides information about the data. Their purpose is to better explain how such data has been acquired, to provide additional information that was not available at experimental time and add key descriptors to make the data easier to find.
  

We, at ESS and as SciCat users/adopters, have decided to adopt different definitions that explain better our technical set-up and embrace all the latest technological advancements in data acquisition where more and more information is produced, acquired and stored digitally.

These are our new definitions:

#### Data
> Data are every measurement, time series and piece of information, quantitative and qualitative, including log book entries, that can be digitally acquired and recorded during the experimental time. Such information is saved in one or multiple files which are generated during the experimental data acquisition.

With this definition, we can cleary infer that what we now call data includes what originally was defined as data and also most of what was defined as metadata.

#### Metadata
> Metadata are any information saved in the data catalogue and available to facilitate search for and find the individual dataset or a group of them and the linked data.  
> Metadata can be:
> 1) a duplicate of any piece of data contained in the linked data files.
> 2) any derived information that results from data aggregation of any sort (like average, min, max or more complex workflow) performed on information contained in the linked data files
> 3) any qualitative or quantitative information that has been collected or discovered at a later stage, it is relevant to describe and facilitate finding the dataset itself.
