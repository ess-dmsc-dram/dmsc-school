# Example

This page illustrates the main code sections on how to access the selected dataset from a Jupyter notebook.
The information presented here assumes that you already have performed the following actions:
- logged in to SciCat
- retrieved your access token, using the SciCat frontend
- selected the dataset(s)
- copied its pid

Please review the [SciCat page](./scicat) if you need more details on where to find this info.  
We use the [Scitacean Python library](./python_libraries) to interact with SciCat from Python.

In addition to the code snippets contained in this page, we have prepared three jupyter notebooks ready for use which you can adapt to your needs in order to download and upload dataset(s).
- [access individual dataset](./notebooks/access_individual_dataset.ipynb)
- [access multiple datasets](./notebooks/access_multiple_datasets.ipynb)
- [upload and create dataset](./notebooks/create_single_dataset.ipynb)

## Use case

Let's say that you have performed a search in the SciCat frontend and you have identified a specific dataset that you would like to use for your data analysis.  
You need two pieces of information: the dataset pid and the access token.
In this example, we use the following:
(You need to use your own token, this one won't work for you.)
```python
dataset_pid = "20.500.12269/761fd17f-e0a8-4bd4-9e70-67ff8647b3f4"
access_token = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJfaWQiOiI2MzliMmE1MWI0MTU0OWY1M2RmOWVjMzYiLCJyZWFsbSI6ImxvY2FsaG9zdCIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoiaW5nZXN0b3IiLCJlbWFpbCI6InNjaWNhdGluZ2VzdG9yQHlvdXIuc2l0ZSIsImVtYWlsVmVyaWZpZWQiOnRydWUsImF1dGhTdHJhdGVneSI6ImxvY2FsIiwiaWQiOiI2MzliMmE1MWI0MTU0OWY1M2RmOWVjMzYiLCJpYXQiOjE2OTIwODc0ODUsImV4cCI6MTY5MjA5MTA4NX0.Phca4UF7WKY367-10Whgwd5jaFjiPku6WsgiPeDh_-o"
```

You also need the address of the SciCat instance.  
In this workshop, we use the "staging" instance which is useful for testing and experimenting:
```python
scicat_instance = "https://staging.scicat.ess.eu/api/v3"
```

First of all, you need to import the scitacean library
```python
from scitacean import Client
from scitacean.transfer.sftp import SFTPFileTransfer
```

Instantiate the client
```python
client = Client.from_token(
    url=scicat_instance,
    token=token,
    file_transfer=SFTPFileTransfer(
        host="sftpserver2.esss.dk"
    ))
```

than request and retrieve the dataset selected
```python
dataset = client.get_dataset(dataset_pid)
```

You can view the dataset information and metadata
```python
dataset
```
This command presents the following view which shows the main information about the dataset.  

![Dataset view in jupyter notebook 1](images/scitacean_dataset_visualization_collapsed.png)  

You can expand the collapsed sections to view the metadata  

![Dataset view in jupyter notebook 2](images/scitacean_dataset_visualization_with_metadata.png)

or the file associated with the dataset.  

![Dataset view in jupyter notebook 3](images/scitacean_dataset_visualization_with_files_list.png)

Once you have verified that the dataset is the correct one, you can download the data files
```python
dset = client.download_files(dset, target="../data", select="60395-2022-02-28_2215.nxs")
dset
```
If we check the files section of the dataset, we can see that the file has been downloaded:  

![Dataset view in jupyter notebook 4](images/scitacean_dataset_visualization_with_downloaded_files.png)

The current status of the dataset indicates that the first file is available locally with path
```bash
..\data\60395-2022-02-28_2215.nxs
```

Please note the relative path.
