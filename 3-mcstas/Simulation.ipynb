    "## Monte Carlo Ray-tracing\n",
    "For simulation of neutron scattering the most popular technique is Monte Carlo ray-tracing. Lets look at the two separately and then merge them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo\n",
    "The Monte Carlo technique relies on using random numbers to estimate values that would otherwise be difficult to calculate. It is a computationally expensive technique, but is very versatile and often work when other more efficient techniques fail. For example one could estimate the value of $\\pi$ by using random sampling to find the ratio of the areas of a circle and a square as shown below. The ratio of their area's can simply be estimated by the number of random points falling outside and inside the circle, from which an estimate of $\\pi$ can be calculated. The more random points we use, the better an estimate of $\\pi$."

    "### Ray-tracing\n",
    "The ray-tracing part of the simulation deals with the paths of the neutrons through space. Thus the geometric effects in the optics can be understood, as the path of the neutrons are traced through the known guide system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monte Carlo ray-tracing\n",
    "Combining these techniques one can start the rays with random velocities drawn from a distribution that resembles the real source, trace the path of the neutrons through the instrument, and at each interaction, random numbers will be used to sample the behavior using the known probability distributions. Repeating this with many rays allow us to estimate for example the flux at the detector, or even the distribution of flux on the detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## McStas\n",
    "The McStas software package is a framework for fast Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations of neutron scattering instruments. The main feature of the code is that it effectively connects a number of smaller pieces of codes called *components* that each describe a spatially separated part of the instrument. Examples of such components could be guide pieces, choppers, samples, monitors and so forth. Instruments are then built from a sequence of such components. When someone has an idea for something new they would like to simulate, it's often easier to create that thing as a McStas component than it would be to write a specialized software package for the purpose. Because of this, the package grows with community contributed components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming language\n",
    "The McStas core and components are all written using the C programming language, though the user interface for assembling the instrument is a meta-language built upon C. This means C code is allowed in parts the file, but it also has a section for adding these components with their parameters and physical positions / rotations with a simple syntax. There also exists a McStas python API called McStasScript, this is what will be used during this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate system\n",
    "To use McStas effectively it is important to understand the coordinate system. The beam direction is generally along the z direction, y points upwards against gravity and x to the left when looking in the beam direction. Furthermore each component will have its own coordinate system, and components can be placed relative to one another. The McStas core handles this complexity so each component can work in a simple local coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Units\n",
    "McStas generally uses SI units with the exception of Å and meV and in few cases $\\mu$s. Physical distances when placing components are given in meters and rotations in degrees. The contributed nature of components however means that their parameters could in principle have any unit, so look in their documentation to be sure, it is typically in the top of the component file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation\n",
    "Often the simulation will run to estimate a intensity, meaning neutrons per second, and will give this result with an error. This error can be reduced by using more rays for the simulation, corresponding to more Monte Carlo samples. To get the expected count from an experiment, one would have to multiply the intensity with the experiment time. It is also important to understand that the error reported by McStas has nothing to do with the expected error in an experiment, that would be calculated from the square root of the number of counts, the McStas error instead measures the quality of the intensity estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick tutorial\n",
    "Thorough Python McStas tutorials can be found with the documentation for McStasScript [here](https://mads-bertelsen.github.io), and for examples in the C syntax one can look in the McStas package or on the package [website](https://www.mcstas.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import the package\n",
    "First the package needs to be installed, then it can be imported. McStasScript also needs to be configured to access the local McStas installation, this is covered in the documentation. It is common to define a shorter name when importing to save some keystrokes, here ms is chosen."
