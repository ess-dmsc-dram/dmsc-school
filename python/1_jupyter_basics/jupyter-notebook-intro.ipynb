Users can get their work done in their own workspaces on shared resources which can be managed efficiently by system administrators. *JupyterHub* runs in the cloud or on users' own hardware, and makes it possible to serve a pre-configured data science environment to any user in the world. It is customizable and scalable, and is suitable for small and large teams, academic courses, and large-scale infrastructure. \n",

    "- **Edit mode**  \n",
    "The *Edit mode* is indicated by a green cell border and a prompt in the cell allowing you to type in.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../images/jupyter/jupyter-notebook-green-code-cell.png\" alt=\"NotebookGreenCodeCell\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",

    "In the *Command mode*,  \n",
    "- you can edit the notebook as a whole, but you cannot type into individual cells.  \n",
    "- the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts that let you perform notebook and cell actions efficiently. For example, if you are in command mode and you press `l`, you will display the line numbers in the current cell - no modifier is needed. The list of defined \"Keyboard shortcuts\" can be accessed by clicking on the `Help` dropdown of the menu bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that trying to type into a cell when in the *Command mode* might result in unexpected things to happen. \n",

    "#### Saving your Notebook\n",
    "Once you start editing your Notebook, it is best practice to save it regularly. Pressing `<ctrl> + S` or `<command> + S` will save your notebook by calling the \"Save and Checkpoint\" command (from the `File` dropdown in the menu bar).\n",

    "> Every time you create a new notebook, a checkpoint file is created as well as your notebook file; it will be located within a hidden subdirectory of your save location called .ipynb_checkpoints and is also a .ipynb file. By default, *Jupyter* will autosave your notebook every 120 seconds to this checkpoint file without altering your primary notebook file. When you \"Save and Checkpoint,\" both the notebook and checkpoint files are updated. Hence, the checkpoint enables you to recover your unsaved work in the event of an unexpected issue. You can revert to the checkpoint from the menu via \"File > Revert to Checkpoint.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Closing your Notebook\n",
    "As mentioned above, when a notebook is opened, its kernel is automatically started. Closing the notebook browser tab will not shut down the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "To shut down the notebook and its kernel, from the menu bar of the notebook, click on  `File` and select `Close and Halt`. Another option is, from the Notebook Dashboard, to select the *Running* notebook you want to close and then click on the `Shutdown` button.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Downloading your Notebook\n",
    "If you want to run the Notebook you created on your own system or if you want to convert it to another format (`Python` script, `.pdf`...), it can be downloaded and converted using, from the `File` dropdown, `Downloads as`."
