    "In order to test for that we use the external package __[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html)__ which provides many utilities for writing tests. Here, we need the context manager `pytest.raises`. Again, there is no need to understand what a context manager is. For our purposes, simply read\n",
