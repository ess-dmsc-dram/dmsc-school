If you need to use the access token in other applications, you can find it under the _settings_ item of the _main menu_ accessible by clicking on the user icon in the top right corner of the page. 
The access token, also called authentication token, is visible under the name __SciCat Token__. As you can see, the UI offers a convenient _copy to clipboard_ functionality.
