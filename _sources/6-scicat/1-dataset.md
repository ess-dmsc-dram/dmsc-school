# Dataset

## What is a dataset?

To improve the understanding of the material presented in this section, we should provide a clear definition of what a __dataset__ is.
There are many definitions in the current literature, but all of them agree on the main concept which defines a _dataset_ as _a collection of related items_.([1], [2], [3])

For our course and in the SciCat world, the definition that we abide by is the following one:

### Dataset

> A Dataset is a collection of multi-modal items which:
> - share a common source
> - were collected for a specific purpose,
> - describe an individual event or a series of linked events or a whole experiment,
> - pertains to the same experimental data collection.  

A dataset might contain one or more files and must have a set of descriptors that, according to the current standards, are called __metadata__ which help users in finding the dataset itself.
