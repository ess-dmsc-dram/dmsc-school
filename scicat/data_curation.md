# Data Curation

After revieweing the vast amount of available literature on the topic(example [1], [2], and [3]), it is important to clearly state and define what is data curation in the context of science and, more specifically, in the context of our course.  

Our definition of **data curation** is the following:
### Data Curation
Data curation is the effort to organize multi-modal data (measurements and observations) collected during an experiment in organized set, named dataset, with the purpose of making the data more logical, easy to find, understand and reproduce.

Data curation referes the complete process of collecting the files with all the data measured during the experiment, including the set of information that is available in lab notebooks or in the memory of scientists and all the actors involved in collecting, reducing and analyzing such data.

In many case, data curation is part of the data management and has to follow the policies highlighted in the adopted data governance, or DMPs (datamanagement plans). In some cases, data curation is used interchangeably with the term data enrichment, although that is not completely accurate.
In our vision, _data enrichment_ is the act of adding additional descriptors to a dataset. This defintion makes it a portion of what we see as data curation.
