    "Now execute the code (`Shift+Enter`). Does it do what you expected?. Now play little bit with the plot properties. *e.g.* changing style, color etc.  First of all try to remove `'o'` from the `plot` function and see what happens.  And then try adding `'r-'` in the same place where we had `'o'` before. The `plot` function has many options and they can be accessed by pressing `Shift+tab+tab` when cursor is pointing on the function (between parentheses) or simply checking [on-line help](https://matplotlib.org/2.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html). You can try out following properties `color='green', linestyle='dashed', marker='o', markerfacecolor='blue', markersize=12` "
