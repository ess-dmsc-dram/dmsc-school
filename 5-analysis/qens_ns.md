# Bayesian analysis of QENS data

```{admonition} Task
:class: important
Consider the QENS data and model from earlier, your colleague notes that both the $\tau$ and $\sigma$ parameters affect the width of the model.
This means that the parameters may be correlated when both are varied.

How would you go about investigating this using a Bayesian method?
