# Dataset

## What is a dataset?

To improve the understanding of the material presented in this section, we should provide a clear definition of what is a __dataset__.
There are many definitions in the current literature, but all of them agree on the main concept which defines a _dataset_ as _a collection of related items_.([1], [2], [3])

For our course and in the SciCat world, the definition that we abide to is this one:

### Dataset

A Dataset is a collection of multi-modal set of items which:
- shares a common source and/or were collected for a specific purpose, 
- describes an individual event or a series of events or an experiment, 
- pertains to the same experimental data collection.  

A dataset might contain one or more files and must have a set of descriptors that, according to the current standards, are called metadata.
