# The `EasyScience` framework

EasyScience is a framework of software tools that can be used to build experimental data analysis packages. 
For example, it has been used in the development of [EasyDiffraction](https://easydiffraction.org) and [EasyReflectometry](https://easyreflectometry.org).
The framework consists of both front- and back-end elements, known as EasyApp and EasyScience, respectively. 
The front-end provides a shared library of graphical interface elements that can be used to build a graphical user interface. 
The back-end offers a toolset to perform model-dependent analysis, including the ability to plug-in existing calculation engines.

The focus in this school is on the Python library, `easyscience`, which can be used to perform complex model-dependent analysis. 
The use of `easyscience` to perform Bayesian sampling, using external libraries, will also be introduced.
